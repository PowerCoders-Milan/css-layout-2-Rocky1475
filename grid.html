      <p>Undisputed number 1 is probably the most famous forest on earth, the South American Amazon. The forest of all forests is
    not only the largest in area, with its incredible 5,500,000 square kilometres, but is also home to one in ten species
    existing on earth. It is the most diverse forest and has the largest range of plants and animals in the world. An
    estimated 290 trillion trees grow in the Amazon. Animals like jaguars, spider monkeys, toucans, sloths and thousands of
    other species are among its inhabitants. It is an impressive 55 million years old forest, but with human influence the
    Amazon has already lost 20% of its original population. That's about 800'000 square kilometres, which is the equivalent
    of the Primorye Forest, the Burmese Rainforest and the Valdivian Rainforest (numbers 10, 9 and 8) together!<br> An
    incredible 90% of this was cleared for the cattle breeding industry. Undisputed number 1 is probably the most famous forest on earth, the South American Amazon. The forest of all forests is
